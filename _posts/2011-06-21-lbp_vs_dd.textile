abstract: >
  Via an oracle experiment, we show that the upper bound on accuracy of a CCG parser is significantly lowered 
  when its search space is pruned using a supertagger, though the supertagger also prunes many bad parses.  
  Inspired by this analysis, we design a single model with both supertagging and parsing features, rather 
  than separating them into distinct models chained together in a pipeline. To overcome the resulting increase 
  in complexity, we experiment with both belief propagation and dual decomposition approaches to inference, 
  the first empirical comparison of these algorithms that we are aware of on a structured natural language 
  processing problem.  On CCGbank we achieve a labelled dependency F-measure of 88.8\% on gold POS tags, 
  and 86.7\% on automatic part-of-speeoch tags, the best reported results for this task.
