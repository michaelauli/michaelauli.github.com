h1. This is the data for my homepage 

It is processed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll 
to create a static site.  This is currently mirrored to my
"University website":http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~alopez
and my "github page":http://alopez.github.com.  Github runs
the data through jekyll automatically when I push to this
repository.

This page is somewhat different from other github pages, because
it's an *academic* webpage that I created using
jekyll, including all of my publications and talks.  The basic
idea is for the papers and talks to show up as stories in a 
news feed.  The post items themselves act as a database which
is used to populate the main page.  I doubt anyone intended
for jekyll to be used this way, but it is flexible enough
and it seems to work.

I don't imagine that there are too many people waiting with
great anticipation for my next publication, but I certainly 
wouldn't mind being alerted when some of my favorite authors
put up their preprints and camera-ready papers, so feel free 
to download my website template, customize it,  and populate with 
your own papers.
