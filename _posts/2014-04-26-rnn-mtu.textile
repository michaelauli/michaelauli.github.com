  We introduce recurrent neural network-based Minimum Translation Unit (MTU) 
  models which make predictions based on an unbounded history of previous 
  bilingual contexts.
  Traditional back-off n-gram models suffer under the sparse nature of MTUs which 
  makes estimation of high-order sequence models challenging.
  We tackle the sparsity problem by modeling MTUs both as bags-of-words and as  
  a sequence of individual source and target words.
  Our best results improve the output of a phrase-based statistical machine 
  translation system trained on WMT 2012 French-English data by up to 1.5 BLEU, 
  and we outperform the traditional n-gram based MTU approach by up to 0.8 BLEU.
