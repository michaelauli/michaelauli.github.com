abstract: >
  Translation systems are complex, and most metrics do little to pinpoint causes of error or isolate system differences.  We use a simple technique to discover induction errors, which occur when good translations are absent from model search spaces.  Our results show that a common pruning heuristic drastically increases induction error, and also strongly suggest that the search spaces of phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based models are highly overlapping despite the well known structural differences.
